# ZenVirtue
ZenVirtue is a meditation application that allows users to meditate for a certain amount of time while music plays in the background. Users can log meditation sessions and keep track of notes as well. We've also included a section that shows the weather, the music that plays during the meditation is dependent on the weather outside.
