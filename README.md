# ZenVirtue
ZenVirtue is a meditation application that allows users to meditate for a certain amount of time while music plays in the background. Users can log meditation sessions and keep track of notes as well. We've also included a section that shows the weather, the music that plays during the meditation is dependent on the weather outside.

## Code
A mixture of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap were used to bring the front end to life while the back end was written with Ruby on Rails.
Open Weather API was used to display current weather.
